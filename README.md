This notebook implements a machine learning model for potato disease classification on a dataset from kaggle below: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faysalmiah1721758/potato-dataset/data


Data:
The notebook utilizes a dataset containing 2152 images of potato leaves categorized into three classes: 
1. "Potato___Early_blight", 
2. "Potato___Late_blight", and 
3. "Potato___healthy".

Preprocessing:
The code loads the images from the dataset.
It resizes all images to a standard size to ensure consistent input for the model.
Data augmentation technique is employed to artificially increase the size and diversity of the training data.


Model Architecture:
The notebook uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, well-suited for image classification tasks.
There is no specific CNN architecture applied in the notebook but a custom one. CNNs typically consist of convolutional layers for feature extraction and pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, followed by fully connected layers for classification.


Training:
The code splits the data into training, validation, and testing sets.
The model is trained on the training data with the validation set used to monitor performance and prevent overfitting.
The notebook employed techniques like adjusting hyperparameters (learning rate, number of layers, etc.) to improve the model's performance.


Evaluation:
Once trained, the model is evaluated on the unseen testing set to assess its generalization ability on new data.
The notebook then use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the model's performance on classifying disease types.

Overall, this notebook demonstrates a common pipeline for image classification using machine learning:
1. Data loading and preprocessing.
2. Model architecture design.
3. Training with hyperparameter tuning (optional).
4. Model evaluation on unseen data.
